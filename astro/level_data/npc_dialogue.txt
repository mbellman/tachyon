+Ah...hello.
I have a keen memory for faces. Yours, I cannot place. Have we met?
Well, I shall continue as I was.

Oh, bugger off! Leave me be, why don't you!
Go away! I've nothing to do with you interlopers!
I've had quite enough of this! Be gone, you scheming lot!

@dweller_river
You're no guardsman...in fact, I don't believe we've crossed paths!
From whence do you hail? Thy dress is like none with which I'm familiar...
Nay, that be of little import...to where dost thou journey?
If thou art headed West, beyond the Falls...I bid thee safe travels.

@dweller_river_2
Oh, do forgive me! I shall make the bridge available to you.
Bid me patience...this will take but a moment.

@villager_gardener
+Oh, greetings. Are you passing through?
If you seek sustenance or lodging, there's an inn, yonder.
I'm afraid I have but limited provisions myself.

@villager_builder
+Hmm...I've not seen you before.
Little time for idle chatter, I'm afraid.

@villager_center
+...
+Thy countenance obscured...
+Though thine eyes recall another's, familiar to me.
Dost thou have special business here?
A subject thy seeketh, perhaps?

@villager_loafer
You there! Come from the southern woodland, aye? Nay?
Well, I advise caution if you're bound for the forest ahead.
The wood is shrouded in fog. Can't tell your head from your rear in there.
At night the mist lessens, though it be to little avail.
No less treacherous of a place, at that.

@villager_loafer_2
+As a matter of fact, might I request a service of you?
+I humbly beg your pardon. But, if you're determined to venture ahead...
So it goes that a rare treasure lies sequestered within these woods.
A local folk tale, perchance, though one I am remiss to ignore.
I would be keen to know if you can trace its whereabouts.
Or, yet more favorable, if you manage to procure it.

@villager_south
+Ah, an unfamiliar face. Well, good day to thee.
I pray our humble town sees fit your needs.
Our old village was displaced, you see.
'Twas decreed by the kingdom's defense ministry.
