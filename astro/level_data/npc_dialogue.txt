Hello, world!
This is a dialogue test.

Oh, bugger off! Leave me be, why don't you!
Go away! I've nothing to do with you interlopers!

@villager_gardener
+Oh, greetings. Are you passing through?
If you seek sustenance or lodging, there's an inn, yonder.
I'm afraid I have but limited provisions myself.

@villager_builder
+Hmm...I've not seen you before.
Little time for idle chatter, I'm afraid.

@villager_center
+...
+Thy countenance obscured...
+Though thy eyes recall another's, familiar to me.
Dost thou have special business here?
A subject thy seeketh, perhaps?

@villager_loafer
+You there! Come from the southern woodland, aye? Nay?
I advise caution if venturing into the forest ahead.
The place is shrouded in fog. Can't tell your head from your rear in there.
At night the mist lessens, though it be to little avail.
No less treacherous of a place, at that.

@villager_south
+Ah, an unfamiliar face. Well, good day to thee.
I pray our humble town sees fit your needs.
Our old village was displaced, you see.
Decreed by the kingdom's defense ministry.
