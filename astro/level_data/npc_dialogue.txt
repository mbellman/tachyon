Hello, world!
This is a dialogue test.

Oh, bugger off! Leave me be, why don't you!
Go away! I've nothing to do with you interlopers!

@villager_gardener
+Oh, greetings. Are you passing through?
If you seek sustenance or lodging, there's an inn, yonder.
Regrettably, I have but limited provisions myself.

@villager_builder
+Hmm...I've not seen you before.
Little time for idle chatter, I'm afraid.

@villager_center
+...
+Thy countenance obscured...
+Though thy eyes recall another, familiar to me.
Dost thou have special business here?
A subject thy seeketh, perhaps?

@villager_loafer
+You! Come from the southern wood, aye? Nay?
The forest ahead is nary safer.
At night the mist lessens, though it be to little avail.
No less treacherous of a place, at that.

@villager_south
+An unfamiliar face. Well, good day to thee.
Considerable toil we spent settling here from the west.
Our old village was displaced, you see.
Decreed by the kingdom's defense ministry.
