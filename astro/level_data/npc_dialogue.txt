+Ah...hello.
I have a keen memory for faces. Yours, I cannot place. Have we met?
Well, I shall continue as I was.

@gate_villager
+Ah, sod it all...the damn thing's locked...
+Why, good heavens! You gave me a right start.
I say, you wouldn't happen to have a key to the gate on hand?
Ah, bugger it...I fear we're in this pickle together, then.
I don't suppose we should ask the next fellow who trods along! Ha.

@gate_villager_cutscene
Oh, thank goodness! You're a gentleman and a scholar.

Oh, bugger off! Leave me be, why don't you!
Go away! I've nothing to do with you interlopers!
I've had quite enough of this! Be gone, the lot of you!

@dweller_river_cutscene
What the devil...? Get away from there at once!

@dweller_river
What in God's name were your intentions? You're clearly no guardsman...
From whence do you hail? Thy garments are like none other's I've seen.
Nay, that be of little import...to where dost thou travel?
If thou art headed West, beyond the Falls...I bid thee a safe journey.

@dweller_river+
Ah! I shall make the bridge available.
Bid me patience...this will take but a moment.
[event: bridge_open]

@dweller_river++
Tarry not! Be on your way.

@villager_gardener
+Oh, greetings. Are you passing through?
If you seek sustenance or lodging, there's an inn, yonder.
I'm afraid I have but limited provisions myself.

@villager_builder
+Hmm...I've not seen you before.
Little time for idle chatter, I'm afraid.

@villager_center
+...
+Thy countenance obscured...
+Though thine eyes recall another's, familiar to me.
Dost thou have special business here?
A subject thy seeketh, perhaps?

@villager_loafer
You there! Come from the southern woodland, aye? Nay?
Well, I advise caution if you're bound for the forest ahead.
The wood is shrouded in fog. Can't tell your head from your rear in there.
At night the mist lessens, though it be to little avail.
No less treacherous of a place, at that.

@villager_loafer+
+As a matter of fact, might I request a service of you?
+I humbly beg your pardon. But, if you're determined to venture ahead...
So it goes that a rare treasure lies sequestered within these woods.
A local folk tale, perchance, though one I am remiss to ignore.
I would be keen to know if you can trace its whereabouts.
Or, yet more favorable, if you manage to procure it.

@villager_south
+Ah, an unfamiliar face. Well, good day to thee.
I pray our humble town sees fit your needs.
Our old village was displaced, you see.
'Twas decreed by the kingdom's defense ministry.
