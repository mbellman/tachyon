+Ah...hello.
I have a keen memory for faces. Yours, I cannot place. Have we met?
Well, I shall continue as I was.

@@watermill_house
Oh, bugger off! Leave me be, why don't you!
Go away! I've nothing to do with you interlopers!
I've had quite enough of this! Be gone, the lot of you!

@villager_gardener
+Oh, greetings. Are you passing through?
If you seek sustenance or lodging, there's an inn, yonder.
I'm afraid I have but limited provisions myself.

@villager_builder
+Hmm...I've not seen you before.
Little time for idle chatter, I'm afraid.

@villager_center
+...
+Thy countenance obscured...
+Though thine eyes recall another's, familiar to me.
Dost thou have special business here?
A subject thy seeketh, perhaps?

@villager_loafer
+You there! Come from the southern woodland, aye? Nay?
+Well, I advise caution if you're bound for the forest ahead.
+Damned place is shrouded in fog. Can't tell your head from your rear in there.
+At night the mist lessens, though it be to little avail.
+No less treacherous of a place, at that.
As a matter of fact, might I request a service of you?
Forgive my forwardness. But, if you're determined to venture ahead...
I've heard tales of a rare treasure sequestered within these woods.
I would be keen to know if you can trace its whereabouts.
Or, yet more favorable, if you manage to procure it.

@villager_south
+Ah, an unfamiliar face. Well, good day to thee.
I pray our humble town sees fit your needs.
Our old village was displaced, you see.
Decreed by the kingdom's defense ministry.
